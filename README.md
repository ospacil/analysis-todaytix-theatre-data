## Analysis of theatre data from TodayTix Group APIs


The aim of this project is to explore data from [TodayTix Group APIs](https://developers.todaytixgroup.com/) on theatre shows, with bias towards the ones I might be interested in :-) I am using this project to learn some new technologies, and play around with Google Cloud Console in particular. So there is probably going to be a mixture of Python and R scripts, some dbt/sql and who knows what.

This is purely a personal project, with no commercial purpose in mind.
